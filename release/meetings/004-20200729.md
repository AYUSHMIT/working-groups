## Notes
* Steering Committee updates
  * Release dependency needs to be defined (ONNX Runtime, etc). Should it depend on converters? 
  * Time based release with exit criteria documented (an issue in ONNX github) Do we have nough features for the time based release?
  * Release package is quite large at the moment. Consider having multiple packages. (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2917)
  * Where should ONNX Runtime live? 
* Reviewed the updated release process doc (PR https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2866)
  * Requested for 1.7 verification details (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2614)
* The release verification should to be clear, transparent, and automated if possible.
  * Scenario 2 is the practical choice, ONNX runtime will be the primary backend to verify release candidates.
* A couple of release automation projects need some updates
  * wheel builder and onnx feedstock
  * Opened an issue to track progress in ONNX repo (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2904)
* Release operational guidelines
  * where to put the guidelines? ONNX or WG repo
* Release 1.8
  * Open an issue to communicate release date, scope, dependencies

## Action items
