## Meeting Notes

* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nhNVkg5uz60iJ7xrW1op-xEhAGOzTW9W-Y4OWlbmtKs/edit?usp=sharing for shared proposal.
* Pipeline parallelsim will be deprioritized in initial implementation. We will focus on tensor parallelism
* Need to think and work on the design for before and after sharding representations, and get the list of operations that can be run distributively.
