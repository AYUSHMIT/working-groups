## Meeting Notes

- Discussions on one model vs multi-model representation of multi-device ONNX
- Disccusion on whether the outcome of this WG - the current goal is to amend the spec so that an optimizer can produce a well-defined model that is meant to be run across multiple devices with some user hints
- Emphasis on providing concrete examples of usage. We need to define the common operations that are used

## Action Items

- @Everyone to review the proposals, think of answers to these high level questions
